        <h2>Notes taken during translating/playtesting in an RTL language (in this case Arabic):</h2>
        <b>You're expected to know EasyRPG's translation tool before reading this.</b>
        <h3>General info</h3>

        <pr>Putting English text in the middle of an Arabic sentence (or word) anywhere flips the said English text
        example: CSE instead of ESC, elppa instead of apple, so they have to be reversed.<pr><br>
        
        <h3>Item/Weapon/Armor/Magic Descriptions</h3>

        <p>Meaning you have to change the order of words from left-to-right because EasyRPG can't render text from Right-To-Left (except message boxes)</p>
        <p>Converting the sentence doesn't work out for RPGM.</p>
        
        <h3>Message boxes (when characters speak)</h3>
        I'm able to type Arabic normally without reversing anything (!مرحى)
        
        <h3>Code language for the <code>meta.ini</code></h3>
        <p>I didn't playtest this with others a lot, but I'll assume it's correct because it makes sense (and because I got no complaints).
        the code language for Arabic translations have to be <a href="http://www.lingoes.net/en/translator/langcode.htm" target="_blank">ar</a>
        as putting for example <code>ar-IQ</code> means only poeple living in Iraq can play it (or I guess only people with their system local set to Arabic Iraq)</p>
        
        <h3>Issues (so far)</h3>
        <p><code>RPG_RT.ldb.common</code> texts don't apply for some reason (they're still in English).
        So far this only happened in LISA The First</p>
        
        <p>Game's font didn't change until I renamed the `Font.ttf` to `Font2.ttf` in the Font folder (shouldn't the former work too?)
        So far this only happened in LISA The First.</p>
